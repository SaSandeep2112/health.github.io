                <ul>
                    <h1>Genetics:</h1>
                    <li>Migraines often run in families, suggesting a genetic predisposition. If one or both parents have a history of migraines, there is an increased likelihood of experiencing migraines.</li>

<h1>Neurological Factors:</h1>
                    <li> Changes in the brainstem and its interactions with the trigeminal nerve, a major pain pathway, are believed to contribute to the initiation of migraines. Imbalances in neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, may also play a role</li>
                    <h1>Hormonal Changes:</h1>
                    <li> Hormonal fluctuations, particularly in women, can trigger migraines. This includes changes related to the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and menopause.</li>

        <h3>Blood pressure</h3>
        <p>Blood pressure is not a disease. It's a measure of the force of blood against artery walls. High blood pressure (hypertension) is when it's consistently too high, and low blood pressure (hypotension) is when it's consistently too low. High blood pressure can lead to serious health issues. Regular monitoring and healthcare guidance are essential.</p>

        <h3>Pimples</h3>
        <p>Pimples are red bumps caused by clogged skin pores. They result from excess oil, dead skin cells, and bacteria. Common on the face, neck, and back, hormonal changes, especially during puberty, can trigger them. Treatments include over-the-counter and prescription options, but avoid picking or squeezing. Good skincare helps prevent pimples, and severe cases may need a dermatologist's attention.</p>

                 <h1>Excess Sebum Production:</h1>
                 <li> Overproduction of oil (sebum) by the sebaceous glands can lead to clogged pores.</li>
                 <h1>Dead Skin Cells:</h1>
                 <li> The shedding of dead skin cells can mix with sebum and clog hair follicles, contributing to pimple formation.</li>
                 <h1>Bacteria: </h1>
                 <li>The presence of Propionibacterium acnes, a bacterium that normally lives on the skin, can contribute to inflammation and the development of pimples.</li>
                 <h1>Hormonal Changes:</h1>
                 <li> Hormonal fluctuations, especially during puberty, menstruation, and pregnancy, can increase sebum production and make individuals more susceptible to pimples.</li>
                 <h1>Genetics:</h1>
                 <li> A family history of acne may increase the likelihood of developing pimples.</li>

                 <li> Some medications, such as corticosteroids or contraceptives, can influence the development of acne in some individuals.</li>
                 <h1>Diet:</h1>
                 <li> While the link between diet and acne is complex and varies from person to person, some studies suggest that certain dietary factors may play a role in acne development.</li>
                 <h1>Friction or Pressure on the Skin:</h1>
                 <li> Constant rubbing or pressure on the skin can cause irritation and contribute to the formation of pimples.</li>
